# Debugging Foreign Key Constraint Issue in Umbraco Document Types

## The Problem

When running the application, we encountered a foreign key constraint error during the creation of the Catalog Page document type:

```
Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteException (0x80004005): SQLite Error 19: 'FOREIGN KEY constraint failed'.
   at Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteException.ThrowExceptionForRC(Int32 rc, sqlite3 db)
   ...
   at Catalog.Plugin.Composers.CatalogPageDocTypeHandler.HandleAsync(UmbracoApplicationStartingNotification notification, CancellationToken cancellationToken) in /Users/leoduran/dev/learning-umbraco/Catalog/src/Plugins/Catalog.Plugin/Composers/CatalogPageDocTypeHandler.cs:line 89
   ...
```

The error occurred specifically at line 89 in the `CatalogPageDocTypeHandler.cs` file, which was the line where we were saving the content type with `_contentTypeService.Save(contentType)`.

## Debugging Approach

To debug this issue, we implemented the following steps:

### 1. Added Comprehensive Logging

We added detailed logging to both the `ProductDocTypeHandler` and `CatalogPageDocTypeHandler` classes to track the execution flow and identify where the error was occurring:

```csharp
_logger.LogInformation("Starting CatalogPageDocTypeHandler.HandleAsync");
// ...
_logger.LogInformation("Checking if content type already exists: {ContentTypeAlias}", contentTypeAlias);
// ...
_logger.LogInformation("Saving content type: {ContentTypeAlias}", contentTypeAlias);
```

### 2. Added Check for Existing Document Types

We implemented checks to see if document types already exist before trying to create them, which helps prevent duplicate creation attempts:

```csharp
var existingContentType = _contentTypeService.Get(contentTypeAlias);
if (existingContentType != null)
{
    _logger.LogInformation("Content type already exists: {ContentTypeAlias}, ID: {ContentTypeId}", contentTypeAlias, existingContentType.Id);
    scope.Complete();
    return;
}
```

### 3. Modified the Order of Handler Execution

We ensured that the `ProductDocTypeHandler` runs before the `CatalogPageDocTypeHandler` since there might be a dependency between them:

```csharp
// Make sure ProductDocTypeHandler runs first, then CatalogPageDocTypeHandler
// This is important because CatalogPageDocTypeHandler might have a dependency on the Product document type
builder
    .AddNotificationAsyncHandler<UmbracoApplicationStartingNotification, ProductDocTypeHandler>()
    .AddNotificationAsyncHandler<UmbracoApplicationStartingNotification, CatalogPageDocTypeHandler>();
```

### 4. Added Dependency Verification

We added code to check if the Product content type exists before creating the Catalog Page content type:

```csharp
// Get the Product content type to ensure it exists
_logger.LogInformation("Checking if Product content type exists");
var productContentType = _contentTypeService.Get("product");
if (productContentType == null)
{
    _logger.LogWarning("Product content type not found. This might cause issues with the MultiNodeTreePicker.");
}
else
{
    _logger.LogInformation("Product content type found with ID: {ProductContentTypeId}", productContentType.Id);
}
```

### 5. Modified the MultiNodeTreePicker Property

We identified that the `MultiNodeTreePicker` property was likely causing the foreign key constraint issue, as it might be trying to reference a content type that doesn't exist yet. We replaced it with a simpler property type:

```csharp
// For now, let's use a simple text property instead of MultiNodeTreePicker
// to avoid the foreign key constraint issue
.AddProperty("Featured Products", "featuredProducts", "Umbraco.TextBox", property => property
    .WithDescription("Comma-separated list of product IDs to feature"))
```

We also updated the template to handle the new property type:

```csharp
@if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(Model.FeaturedProducts))
{
    <section class="featured-products">
        <h2>Featured Products</h2>
        <div class="product-grid">
            <!-- Featured products would be loaded here based on IDs -->
            <p>Featured product IDs: @Model.FeaturedProducts</p>
        </div>
    </section>
}
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Foreign Key Constraints**: When working with Umbraco document types, be aware of potential foreign key constraints, especially when one document type references another.

2. **Order of Execution**: The order in which document types are created matters, especially when there are dependencies between them.

3. **Proper Logging**: Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging complex issues in Umbraco applications.

4. **Simplify First**: When facing issues with complex property editors like `MultiNodeTreePicker`, start with simpler property types to isolate the problem.

5. **Check for Existence**: Always check if document types already exist before creating them to prevent duplicate creation attempts.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Solution**: Run the application to see if the changes resolve the foreign key constraint issue.

2. **Implement Proper MultiNodeTreePicker**: Once the basic structure is working, we can revisit implementing the `MultiNodeTreePicker` with proper configuration.

3. **Create a Data Type**: We might need to create a specific data type for the `MultiNodeTreePicker` that explicitly allows selecting products.

4. **Update Template**: Update the template to properly handle the product references, either as IDs or as actual content nodes.
